            Agricultureâ€™s far-reaching impacts make it equally crucial to widen
            our view and gain new insights by entering multidisciplinary
            partnerships across agricultural value chains. Partnership is
            essential if we are to successfully drive advances in sustainable
            agriculture. Together, we can help farmers grow healthy, affordable,
            high-quality food safely and protect the land that we all hold in
            trust for future generations.

            Farmers across the globe are working to meet the ever-increasing
            demand for sustainably grown cotton. BASF brought together a global
            delegation of farmers from Europe and the United States to ensure
            their voices are heard and supported. This is one way how BASF
            contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
